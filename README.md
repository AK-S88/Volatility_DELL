# Dell Technologies: Operational Volatility Analysis 📊

## Project Overview 🎯
During my capstone project at Dell Technologies, I collaborated with a team to develop a comprehensive framework for quantifying and analyzing operational volatility in deal management processes. Using three quarters of operational data comprising 2.4 million records, we created a sophisticated volatility scoring system that combined both immediate and running volatility metrics.

## Key Findings 📈
- Booked deals exhibited 67% higher volatility than non-booked deals
- Significant volatility peaks occurred at quarter-ends
- Deals with shorter timelines (0-3 weeks) showed the highest volatility (0.985)

## Technical Implementation 💻
- Developed a composite volatility score using advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
- Created interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring of operational metrics
- Implemented comprehensive data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks

## Business Impact 🚀
The project's findings enabled Dell to better understand and manage deal volatility patterns, ultimately supporting more efficient resource allocation and improved operational stability. Our work demonstrated the practical application of data analytics in solving complex business challenges while providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
